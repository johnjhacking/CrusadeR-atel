## Instructions
1. If you're on Windows, make a new directory on C:\ called "opt", and then download this directory into it
2. If you're on Linux, you'll have to edit line 259 of commander-kono.qss to change the path of the image. You can also do this if you'd rather have this directory elsewhere on Windows, just ensure that you update it.
